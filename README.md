# cvbs-ai-decode

Program with a simple goal decode cvbs video using AI

this project is related to the project ld-decode and use .tbc file generated by it.
it can also be used with my project fl2K_2 for playing .tbc file after AI Y/C separation.

# How to use
(warning only the Y/C model is viable the other are just prototype for now)
To use the program you need to have ffmpeg instaled and in the system path.
then go to "script/windows" or "script/linux" folder depending of your OS
the folder contain 4 script :
  - ai_decode_ntsc_file
  - ai_decode_ntsc_preview
  - ai_decode_ntsc_tbc_file
  - ai_decode_ntsc_yc_file

you just need to drag and drop your .tbc file on the script you want to use
you can also open a terminal and run the script from there by putting your tbc file in parametter od the script

for using result file with ld-decode tools and fl2K_2 you can use script contained in the folder "other_script" or use your own.
